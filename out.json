Intro</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICONDA is an ambitious team with strong understanding about the blockchain technology and we aim to become a leading P-Rep in Latin America. Our team is comprised of five dedicated ICONists, experts who have a long history of running large capacity services. We want to expand the ICON Network&#39;s ecosystem in Latin America and spread ICX-based economy in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Motivation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since ICON project is based in Korea, we realized that their presence in Brazilian blockchain community is not distinctive despite the fact that all blockchains are global projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe P-Rep election is meaningful in that this is the first step to establishment of a truly &ldquo;decentralized network&rdquo;. By the nature of public blockchain, having a node scattered around the world is crucial to stability of the network. As we have background knowledge in blockchain technology and governance, we will run a stable node and make the ICON Network more solid and at the same time let people in Latin America know about ICON better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>1) Community Building</strong><br />\r\nWe will organize various blockchain events ranging from small meetups to conferences across Latin America. These events will provide opportunities for ICON supporters to network and share their thoughts on the ICON Network. Once we are elected as a P-Rep, we will bring up agenda that helps to improve the ICON Network governance. Furthermore, we will create media contents on the ICON Network, ICON DApps, and other related services or activities in Spanish and share to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Infrastructure</strong><br />\r\nWe will locate the server in Brazil at the beginning, but in the long term, we will strategically spread out to other regions of Latin America, hire and educate more developers to accomplish our mission. Such expansion will provide better environment to decentralization of the ICON Network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Token Economy&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nWe will implement ICX-based token economy to local society of Latin America. Many Latin American countries are lacking stability of their traditional currency. We plan to build a local marketplace where people can trade using ICX instead of legacy currency.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSpecifically, we will develop a simple billing system and a dashboard solution that enables sellers to easily manage transaction information. At the end of the way, our ultimate goal is to create friendly environment for cross-border trade based on ICX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Weekly Report</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;ICONDA team will create weekly reports on the latest trends of the blockchain industry. The contents will include status report of the cryptocurrency exchanges and overall market sentiment, and share with the ICON Community.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMore importantly, we plan to analyze the transaction volume and market condition of the ICON Network, which is useful and at the same time crucial to investors. This will help the investors to understand, grow a broader viewpoint about the blockchain industry, and make a reasonable cryptocurrency investment.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. When</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Community Building</strong><br />\r\nICONDA has a vision to build a community of people who want to be part of token economy based on the ICON Network. Our mission will start immediately and will go on as a long-term project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>2) Infrastructure</strong><br />\r\nThe initial server installation is already being planned and will be done right away. ICONDA plans to build the basic infrastructure by 2019 4Q and further expand the system depending on network demand by 2020 1Q.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>3) Token Economy</strong><br />\r\nWe are doing research on ICON Network&rsquo;s token economy and how to expand and apply to the real world. The basic research will end around 2019 4Q and the prototype testing will commence within 2020 1Q.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>4) Weekly Report&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nWe will publish a weekly report as soon as soon as we are elected as a P-Rep.</p>", "display": true, "created_at": "2019-01-14T09:54:14.480Z", "updated_at": "2019-01-18T02:27:15.361Z"}}, {"model": "core.prep", "pk": 39, "fields": {"name": "ICON Sweden", "email": "syed.ali.mushabbar.sadiq@gmail.com", "location": "Sweden", "introduction": "\"ICON Sweden\" is highly energetic, dynamic, optimistic and ambitious team with sound understanding about the Blockchain Technology.

Motivation of the proposal</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We aim to become a leading P-Rep in the west. We will help ICON ecosystem to expand in the west. We also have presence in Asia and contacts in Africa. We will help to ensure ICON becomes a truly&nbsp;Decentralized Network.&nbsp;We supports DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Serving masses (including ICONist&nbsp;Global Communities) is our top priority. We will start serving by&nbsp;<strong>Awareness</strong>, <strong>Education</strong>, <strong>Engagement</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Support</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will build and deploy secure, reliable, resilient, and trusted infrastructure by following industry best practices.

Execution plan of the proposal</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) ICONist&nbsp;Community Building</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community building is a vital part of the success and mass market adoption. We will start to&nbsp;build communities using both social media tools and face-to-face meetups. We will organize events, meetups and participate in conferences in our target regions. We will ensure that every&nbsp;ICONist is involved and plays a role to contribute for the growth of ICON ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Governance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have experience in Blockchain&nbsp;Governance, especially gained from EOSIO chains (such as Telos Governance). We will raise awareness about&nbsp;the importance of Governance. We will try to&nbsp;make&nbsp;sure that ICONist plays an important role in the governance process by utilizing their voting weight to choose appropriate P-Reps that matches their wishes and believes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Blocks Production Infrastructure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will build, configure and deploy ICON recommended high end infrastructure. Initially we will use AWS Cloud. And we are ready to do it at any time. We have experience and already have deployed&nbsp;Blocks Production Hybrid-Cloud Infrastructure for EOSIO Chains. We have working, legally&nbsp;registered company and have established contacts with <strong>Cloud</strong> and <strong>Bare Metal</strong> service providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will prefer to deploy infrastructure in EU (European Union) due to EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other privacy legislations compliance. But we have the capability to deploy cloud infrastructure at any other region (if and as needed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Decentralized and Centralized Applications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Useful applications play a critical role in the success of any blockchain based ecosystem. We recognize the importance to tools and applications. We will support the development of innovative applications. We are very much interested to support, develop and&nbsp;bring real-world day-to-day used consumer and enterprise applications on the ICON Blockchain Network. We think that ICON is Enterprise and GRC friendly and could bridge the gap between the Crypto World and Ordinary day-to-day World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) Regular Weekly Reports</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will create regular weekly reports on our progress, as well as the status of ICON Blockchain ecosystem. We already have several social media channels where we publish reports and videos regarding different aspects of the Blockchain Technology, including trends and latest happenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>4. Expected timeline of the proposal</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) ICONist&nbsp;Community Building</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can start it immediately.

With its particular advantages, this appealing location with close proximity to international communities will help to raise a unique awareness assisting engagement with US markets as well as global participants to become clients of Iconode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Icon Blockchain has developed, Iconode has been in the frontline of identifying the correct timing of inserting itself into the space. The proper structure has been delineated and we have also made successful progress in obtaining interest of partners, as well as clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iconode looks to serve as a conduit for those who while being economically able, may not specifically align with the technology to enter the space.<br />\r\nWe are reducing barriers to ease market entry for participants while helping to create and maximize opportunities in decentralization, data efficiency and process management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our adamant early-mover position naturally provides us with a competitive advantage given the industry&rsquo;s dynamics.<br />\r\nCurrently, the competitive landscape is limited due to the very high barriers to entry &ndash; the solutions require computational capabilities, a significant installed base, business and tax knowledge that must be complemented with the ability to obtain then service large scale delegations maintaining client support and operational up-time. Therefore, our experience combined with the industry&rsquo;s current early stage development, in fact, enables us to secure operating share and subsequently, maintain a solid position in the icon ecosystem. We have also taken a view of the potential future changes to the industry in the areas of regulation, taxation, jurisdiction and institutional involvement and have accordingly built a structure capable of mitigating and adapting to overcome new challenges fostering perseverance and growth. &nbsp;<br />\r\nMoreover, Iconode&rsquo;s management focus will allow it to maintain a high status within the community as it serves its purpose and improves the community&rsquo;s awareness, understanding, market access and use of these technologies. Iconode also distinguishes itself by its ability to attract institutional investment and user&#39;s focus to the Icon Blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our double prong business model focuses on servicing or partnering with institutions thereby requiring larger services from our team. However, we are also organizing a campaign to target delegations directly from the public.<br />\r\nOur success is measured by; 1) The amounts of tokens delegated to Iconode, 2) Agreements that drive the flow of delegated icx, And 3) Increased awareness of the icon network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being located in Puerto Rico is important to the project, as Puerto Rico continues to grow as a unique jurisdiction in the Blockchain space. The structure has been designed so that the Tax Incentives granted by Puerto Rico are not only beneficial to Iconode LLC, but also serve as an attractive element for potential investors and partnerships. The skilled pool of engineering talent available in Puerto Rico will directly impact the continued expansion of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Team has set-up prior successful business ventures in other spaces and has identified the need for this type of service in an early time which allows for competitive advantage in gaining market share and producing quality user experiences. The team is able to explain the project and processes to develop the proper relationships needed to secure additional funding, develop support products and obtain new users from areas not conventionally associated with blockchain communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n#2) MOTIVATION OF PROPOSAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decentralization is a Marvel we desire to usher into common use.

Cryptocurrencies have become more recognized and accepted as a financial asset class and we believe that building sophisticated financial products to meet the management profile and transparency requirements will lead to more adoption, especially from the traditional finance sector. We will be using ICON&rsquo;s &nbsp;ICON service API and SCORE function to scale our services to enterprise-level, and at the same time contribute to ICON&rsquo;s ecosystem by 1) issuing multiple IRC2 tokens and leveraging SCORE-based smart contracts which will be used in our platform and 2) increasing the use case of ICX tokens and the network. ICONists and ICX holders can use their ICX tokens for VELIC&#39;s services which include cryptocurrency storage, crypto-to-crypto exchange, crypto collateralized loans, and asset management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team consist of members from the financial and blockchain industry sharing a common goal; to provide reliable and convenient crypto financial services for everyone. Leveraging extensive experience in finance, our management has been working with developers and contributors to create a security focused crypto-finance platform on top of the ICON network, upon which a range of practical products and services are being built and delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are located in Singapore which is considered one of the largest blockchain industry cluster. We will be closely monitoring the trends and paradigm shifts in the market and prepare and respond to any regulatory movements that could impact the space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MOTIVATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VELIC embraces ICON&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;connecting the crypto world to our real world&rdquo; by advancing the performance, ease of use and service quality related to dealing with crypto assets, ICX tokens in particular. We believe that use of ICX tokens should not be limited by trading pairs, network transactions or community interactions and that by offering more services applicable to real world practices it will define the intrinsic value of ICX tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VALUE PROPOSITION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VELIC platform itself will be a decentralized application (DApp) of ICON, therefore an active participant of the network and a major contributor to the token economy. We will be issuing multiple IRC2 tokens for the platform, and conversions between these tokens will be deployed by SCORE, and broadcasted through the ICON network. We anticipate that this will significantly increase the transaction volume on the network, increasing the circulation of ICX tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VELIC also focuses on empowering three key components of the ICON republic; the ICON ecosystem created and maintained by communities, DApps that provide different services to the public blockchain network, and most importantly ICX users, the supporters and contributors of ICON.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) &nbsp;The ICON Ecosystem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VELIC will bring value to the ICON Ecosystem by providing services that encourage the consumption of ICX tokens. We believe increasing number of services available with ICX will induce more users and contribute to the overall growth of the ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our initiatives for the ICON ecosystem include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;a) to become the financial backbone of the various ecosystem participants: we will provide custody, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trading, lending and asset management services for ICX holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;b) promote activity on the ecosystem by generating sizable transactions: we are issuing multiple IRC2 tokens, which will be transferred in and out on a daily basis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;c) maintain a Node backed by institutional-level security</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Services for DApps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand DApps play an integral role in the ICON Network, and VELIC will provide the following services to help DApp operators:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) primary venue for IRC DApp&rsquo;s IEO/IAO + listing: VELIC will be a reliable partner for ICON &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DApps in terms of due diligence, fundraising and user acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b) funding source (cash flow management) even after IAO, in the form of loans using various &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryptocurrencies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) corporate finance / asset management for DApps: allows DApp developers and operators to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focus on developing their product and services while VELIC provides asset management services to ensure long-term viability</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) For the ICON community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VELIC will continue to promote the ICONSENSUS vision of mass adoption of blockchain by continuing to build applicable product and services using ICX tokens. Some of the services in the pipeline include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) promote development of useful DApps as outlined above</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b) funding source: we will be offering financing service for various ICON ecosystem participants including ICX holders and DApps</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) provide essential asset management &amp; key storage services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d) plans to offer staking service for PoS tokens under the storage system</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EXPECTED TIMELINE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporation (Singapore) - Completed August, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRC2 Token Issuance - Expected February, 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCORE implementation - Expected February, 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VELIC Service Launch - Expected March, 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Effective immediately after P-Rep Election</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community Engagement - We will open social media channels to engage with the community, and topics requiring a consensus will be posted on our website for further discussion and votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weekly Reports - Contents on the weekly reports will include: industry news, cryptocurrency market capitalizations, ICON network status, and ICON community news</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>", "display": true, "created_at": "2019-02-01T07:00:02.805Z", "updated_at": "2019-02-01T07:00:02.805Z"}}, {"model": "core.prep", "pk": 46, "fields": {"name": "reda azzouz", "email": "redasirius2@protonmail.com", "location": "morocco", "introduction": "Hello i will love to join the program, i suported the program since the ico", "server_location": "T\u00e9touan, Morocco", "server_location_latlong": "(35.59369633736335, -5.332406068670139)", "server_type": "Bare metal server", "server_spec": "Dual Xeon 4.0ghz 160GB RAM 10GB Bandwich", "logo": "logos/avatar_l.png", "proposal_rich": "<p>1.

Proposal introduction</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>DRAICON BALL team aims to help ICON in achieving its goal of creating a change in the world through decentralization. &nbsp;Specifically we will not only provide a stable network condition but will also help dApps succeed in ICON Network. We will also support development and growth of various needed in ICON Network in the future. &nbsp;Our main goal is to promote and help grow ICON Network by providing the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dependable infrastructure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>DRAICON BALL will provide block generating and verifying infrastructure to help ICON Network seamlessly operate. &nbsp;We view dependability as below:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Reliability: to give credibility and verifiability to block generating node&rsquo;s data.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Availability (fault tolerance): to provide ability to handle block generating node&rsquo;s system faults.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Security: to protect the node from ill intent contact.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>dApp ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, promotion and growth of dApp ecosystem is critically important to all blockchain platforms, not just for ICON Network. &nbsp;We will focus on the dApp ecosystem growth and promotion. Another major goal is to create a virtuous cycle in which credible and innovative dApps are attracted to and utilize ICON Network. &nbsp;For these goals, we will contribute the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Awareness: to increase the general awareness of dApp being registered to ICON Network to help the said dApp succeed.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Barrier to entry: to help eliminate the barrier to entry for dApps starting services.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Promotion: to help promote and market dApps before their service launch.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Investment: to help execute investment into dApp.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Oracle ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oracle is critical for ICON Network to connect to the outside world. &nbsp;DRAICON BALL team will build decentralized Oracle ecosystem to connect diverse networks with ICON Network. &nbsp;Through this effort, dApps within ICON Network will be able to receive and provide better and more various external data. &nbsp;DRAINCON BALL will contribute the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Governance &amp; Reputation: to build decentralized Oracle governance and reputation system.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Data: to enable identification of necessary data needed by a dApp.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Participation: to open Oracle for participation to anyone.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interchain</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Interchain is one of the core objectives of ICON where various decentralized networks and blockchains are connected. &nbsp;Interchain enables value or asset swapping between blockchains and also enables smart contracts&rsquo; interworking. More specifically, interchain allows using Ethereum dApp by using ICX or using BTC or ETH for ICON dApp. &nbsp;DRAICON BALL team fully believes these revolutionary changes will occur in the near future. We will contribute the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Status: to easily gauge and understand the interchain supported by ICON Network.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Value exchange: to establish value exchange ecosystem through ICONist and users of other blockchain networks and stabilize token flow for value exchange.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Awareness: to communicate and promote use cases of dApps using interchain to further develop the value of interchain.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>2. Motivation of the proposal</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>DRAICON BALL team believes decentralization is a disruptive force that will hyper-connect the world through the blockchain technology. &nbsp;We find ICON&rsquo;s ideaology consistent with ours in this regard, hence the reason for our application to the P-Rep. The main purpose of our team is to increase the value of ICON Network by actively growing dApp ecosystem and building the Oracle ecosystem which is a necessary element in current and future ICON Network. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>3. Execution plan of the proposal</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dependable infrastructure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leading IaaS vendor, providing cloud infrastructure to the largest number of customers in the world. &nbsp;We will use AWS but we will not stop there. In case a system failure occurs at a block generating node, a spare node that can be switched immediately and seamlessly will be utilized. &nbsp;Also, to prevent malicious access or ddos attack, infrastructure will be constructed by propagating the block generation result to the outside through the full node connected to the block generating node without exposing the block generating node directly to the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>dApp ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will provide dashboard web service to show information of network&rsquo;s dApps at a glance. &nbsp;It will provide information on both registered dApps and dApps in process of registration. dApps will be able to promote their services through this space and attract ICONists&rsquo; investment. Dashboard will also provide voting function for dApps for ICONists. We believe this service will encourage more active participation by ICONists resulting in growth of ICON Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Oracle ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Oracle ecosystem, 1) anyone can be Oracle, 2) anyone can evaluate data provided by Oracle. DRAICON BALL team will provide web service to satisfy these two conditions and establish governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Oracle web service: ICONists can request the data they need and identify which Oracle is providing what data. Oracle data users will evaluate and rate data providers on the accuracy of data.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Oracle governance: Oracle data evaluation results will be reflected in Oracle&rsquo;s reputation. &nbsp;Each Oracle can receive incentives or penalties through a reputation system. Oracle governance will operate through the use of ICON&rsquo;s smart contract.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interchain</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>DRAINCON BALL team will execute two critical missions below for success of interchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Value swap ecosystem construction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For value swap ecosystem, token liquidity needs to be stabilized. &nbsp;For example, if ICX is to be exchanged for ETH, ETH needs to be pre-allocated. &nbsp;In order for the value swap ecosystem to be active and functional, 1) anyone should be able to contribute to token liquidity and 2) those who contribute to token liquidity must be compensated. &nbsp;Specific details are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Build a token economy for the value swap ecosystem.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Provide a web service that allows easy identification of token liquidity for value swaps and allows anyone to participate in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Interchain vitalization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the web service provided by DRAICON BALL team, status of interchain and major use cases will be summarized. &nbsp;We will be open to and respond to policy suggestions or issues related to interchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketing, Promotion &amp; Education</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe &ldquo;Interoperability&rdquo; is the main driving force behind Icon and its future plans moving forward. &nbsp;We will focus on promoting the importance of interoperability and act as an outlet to announce and spread the strategic executions carried out by the Icon team to achieve hyper connectivity. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will devote our efforts into two categories to help the mass better understand Icon&rsquo;s interoperability objectives and initiatives:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Structure-wise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Icon&rsquo;s interoperability can be divided into two categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Within Icon&rsquo;s Nexus: Interoperability between Icon/ICX (public) &amp; IconLoop (private)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Outside Icon&rsquo;s Nexus: Interoperability between Icon protocol &amp; other blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Neo.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Business strategy-wise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within Icon&rsquo;s interoperability between Icon/ICX &amp; IconLoop, we will educate and promote Icon&rsquo;s efforts with IconLoop, private blockchain for enterprise:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Industries &amp; partnerships</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>dApp ecosystem and its development</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>4. Expected timeline of the proposal (Roadmap)</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>2019 2Q</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>DRAICON BALL team introduction and website development</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2019 3Q</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>dApp dashboard development within DRAICON BALL website</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2019 4Q</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>dApp dashboard stabilization and development of various value-add functions</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2020 1H</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Continue dApp dashboard stabilization and development of various value-add functions</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Dependable infrastructure development</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>2020 2H~</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Development of web service for Oracle ecosystem</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Development of web service for Interchain</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>", "display": true, "created_at": "2019-02-17T15:18:31.356Z", "updated_at": "2019-02-18T02:29:27.878Z"}}, {"model": "core.prepteam", "pk": 37, "fields": {"avatar": "avatars/t1.png", "name": "Noah, Smith", "background": "Leader.
